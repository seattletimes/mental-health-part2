      <li>Thank you for reaching out to us regarding Smokey Point Behavioral Hospital and raising these concerns. At Smokey Point, we care for many of the sickest members of our community. Our patients turn to us in crisis and we take our responsibility to provide the highest level of quality care in the safest of therapeutic environments with the upmost seriousness. We are first and foremost caregivers and the health and safety of our patients is our top priority.</li>
      <li>We opened Smokey Point Behavioral  Hospital in 2017 in response to the mental health crisis in Washington. Prior to our opening, many residents were forced to leave the area and travel long distances for care or to forgo care altogether. Smoky Point Behavioral Hospital is the first new psychiatric hospital to open in Western Washington in over 50 years. We have treated nearly 4000 patients and most of the patients who we treat are funded by Medicaid and Medicare programs and are among the neediest members of our community. Smokey Point has been and continues to be, fully compliant with all state and federal regulations. We continue to work proactively with the state on a voluntary basis to achieve the highest levels of quality care.</li>
      <li>As you likely know, federal and state mental health spending has decreased dramatically over the past few decades which has ultimately led us to the significant crisis we see today. The recent coverage of KOMO TV’s “Seattle is Dying” and the recent stabbing at Nordstrom in downtown Seattle are continuing to bring this critical conversation to the forefront. Our organization was founded to increase access to behavioral health care by providing high-quality, individualized services to all patients in need, regardless of ability to pay. Our team has operated 21 psychiatric hospitals over the years and all of our hospitals have been fully compliant with all state and federal regulations.</li>
      <li>Sincerely, Richard A. Kresch, MD</li>
