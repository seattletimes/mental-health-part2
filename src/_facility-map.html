<div class="source">Note: The Seattle Times is providing these reports of violations identified by government inspectors at private psychiatric hospitals in Washington state. The reports include violations found during annual licensing surveys and complaint investigations. In some cases, inspectors produced two separate reports for the same inspection to cite violations under distinct state and federal standards. These records do not include inspections where a regulator found no violations. They may not include every violation report, and this database will not be updated in real-time. You can also request statements of deficiencies directly from the <a href="mailto:PDRC@doh.wa.gov" target="_blank">Washington state Department of Health</a> and the <a href="mailto:CMS_RO10_CEB@cms.hhs.gov" target="_blank">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a></div>
