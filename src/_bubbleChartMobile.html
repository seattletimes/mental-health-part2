        <section class="chatter">
          <p>When patients or staff suffer serious, largely preventable harm, hospitals in Washington state are supposed to notify the Department of Health. Between 2016 and 2018, private psychiatric hospitals reported a combined 15 “adverse events,” which are exempt from public disclosure. Over the same period, The Seattle Times found 350 assaults, injuries, escapes, suicide attempts, sudden deaths and other incidents that harmed staff or patients. Many likely didn’t meet the state’s high, narrow criteria for mandatory reporting, but The Times included them to give a more complete picture of safety at these facilities. Below are incidents for which The Times located a public record.</p>
